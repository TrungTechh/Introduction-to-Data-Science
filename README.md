# Introduction-to-Data-Science
Is the movie industry dying? How did movide changed by the time? Those were the first questions that lead me to do this project on movie data from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and analyze it over the last decades. But, why stop there? There are more factors that intervene in this kind of thing, like actors, genres, user ratings and more. And now, anyone with experience (you) can ask specific questions about the
movie industry, and get answers.

### About folders
`/collect_data`: we crawl data from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) and save as csv file in `/data` </br>
`/explore_data`: use data visualization and statistical techniques to describe dataset characterizations, such as size, quantity, and accuracy, in order to better understand the nature of the data. Then we do
filter out the data applicable for the problem, merge different datasets, clean the data - eliminating inaccurate data, treating missing values and outliers</br>
`/analysis_data`: we answer some meaningful question using data analysis techniques and get an deep understanding about the data </br>
`/model`: Lastly, we build a simple model to predict score of the movie
